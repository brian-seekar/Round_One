## Kiva Rwanda: Strategic Loan Analysis & Forecasting

Analyzed 3.5 years of Kiva crowdfunding data for Rwanda to identify operational trends and forecast annual performance.
Key Contributions:

- **Data Integrity & Logic:** Developed custom validation scripts to resolve inconsistencies in loan timestamps (posted vs. disbursed dates), ensuring data reliability.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Leveraged nltk to tokenize and analyze loan descriptions, identifying "buy targets" and sector-specific funding patterns.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Built a Linear Regression model to extrapolate a 30% data gap in 2017, providing a more accurate estimation of year-over-year growth.

**Technical Stack:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Matplotlib/Seaborn), Git, and Linux-native development environments.
